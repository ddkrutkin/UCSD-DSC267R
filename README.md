Course repo for Data fairness and ethics

## Project 2: Data Analysis
### ⚠️ WARNING: Dataset contains sensitive subject matters from real-world tweets. ⚠️

### Assignment Description:
Values and ethical choices arise throughout multiple parts of data modeling and analysis (i.e., before the model is actually used in the real world). Written reports are a standard way of communicating model performance, and the second team project is to conduct a data analysis (on actual data), and then explain and justify your work in terms of both ethics/values and performance. The report should be written for the manager/lead of a data science/analysis team (i.e., someone who is generally familiar with relevant data science methods but not necessarily used to thinking about ethical considerations).


More specifically, you should provide a data analysis report that includes (at least) the following elements, though they can be addressed in an integrated manner:

A. describe the real-world challenge that you are addressing in your analysis
B. explain the data that you are using, including the source(s) and their measurement protocols
C. identify at least three different potential ethical concerns about analyzing/modeling these data for that challenge
D. identify at least two challenges (perhaps ethical, perhaps practical) to ensure that people outside your team understand how to interpret and use your models
describe the analysis/models that you developed, including relevant levels of technical detail
F. explain how your data science effort responds to the concerns & challenges from C. and D. (e.g., through your choice of methods, or the use of multiple measures of “goodness,” or particular types of explainable models, or …)
